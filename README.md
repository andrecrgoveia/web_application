# Web Application
Web application created using Django and Python!

The purpose of this application is just for learning, exploring what Django can offer when we are developing web applications.

The application consists of a page of a fictitious company, where whoever is managing the information that will be presented will use the Django administrative panel.

On the dashboard, information on types of business and service pricing can be added, edited and deleted with ease.

In this project, the concepts of extension and redirection of urls and sending of emails were addressed.
